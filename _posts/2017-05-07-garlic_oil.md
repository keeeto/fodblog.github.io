title: Garlic oil
---

	1 cup oil (vegetable, sunflower, olive, as you please)
	6 cloves of garlic peeled
	
* Put the oil and the garlic in a small flat-bottomed saucepan.
Heat over a medium heat.

* When the garlic starts to go deep brown (15 - 20ish minutes) remove from the heat and allow to cool.

* When cool strain the oil through a fine sieve into a sterilised jar. Here’s how to sterilise a jar.

* The oil you make this way will keep for about a week in the fridge.

* Feel free to combine garlic and onion if that’s what you want. I find it gives more flexibility to do them separately, but it is more of a pain to do.
