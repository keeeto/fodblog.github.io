*Cream* **Prince**

This soup can be taken warm in winter or as a cool starter in warmer weather. The creamy yoghurt with fresh aromatic mint and dill is sure to satisfy you whatever the weather.

This one you probably want to stick to small portions of. Greek yoghurt has less lactose than regular yoghurt as it is removed to make it creamier, but it does still have some. If lactose is a real problem, substitute in lactose free Greek yoghurt.
