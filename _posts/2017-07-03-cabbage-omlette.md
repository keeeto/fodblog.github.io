Continuing the omelette odyssey. This time its a breakfast with a slight Asian feel to it. The pickled red cabbage here is made with star anise and quite an amount of sugar, so it's on the sweet end of the pickle spectrum; also it goes really well with the [pork meatballs](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/porkballs/) in a sandwich. The feta brings a creamy saltiness and the addition of soy to the omelette mix brings the umami to complete the flavour spectrum. Steamed cavelo nero on the side sets off the heaviness of the main omelette.

The basic omelette recipe is [here](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/omelette/). Follow that recipe (adding 1 tablespoon of soy sauce to the mix before cooking), with the 2 teaspoons of following filling. The red cabbage will be enough to keep for other purposes, but hey pickle is for keeping.

**Serves 2**

	100g caster sugar
	100g red wine vinegar
	200g water
	4 star anise
	1/4 red cabbage, very finely shredded
	2 handfuls of rough chopped (or baby) cavolo nero (or any green cabbage)
	
* Put the sugar, water, vinegar and star anise into a saucepan and bring to the boil
* Take off the heat and allow to cool to room temperature
* Add the red cabbage and allow to sit for 2 hours
* Drain off the cabbage and store for use whenever
* Crumble up the feta and mix with 3 tablespoons of the cabbage
* Steam the cavolo nero for 3 minutes - set aside still over the hot water, but off the heat, this will keep it warm
* Make the omelette as described [here](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/omelette/)
* When the omelette is getting firm, spoon the cabbage and feta over on half of the omelette mix
* Flip the other half over the top and cook for another 2 minutes to melt the cheese
* Cut the resulting omelette in half and serve with the cavolo nero along side
