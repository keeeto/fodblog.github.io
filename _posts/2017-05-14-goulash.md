Goulash is a paprika based stew of the Austro-Hungarian empire. For me it evokes an air of symbolism and philosophy; a refined, decaying culture; heavy carpets, velevt curtains and rich tobacco smoke. It is also one of the best stews there is. 




Of course, as with all types of stew there is a rich cultural heritage (or maybe baggage) that goes with it. There is no one definitive Goulash, and what we have below is sure to annoy some purists (in the unlikely event they ever encounter it). For a fascinating inight and lineage of different Goulash, I found [this page](http://www.cooksinfo.com/goulash) extremly enlightening.

This can be served with dumplings or potatoes. It is also excellent with a pickled cucumber on the side to cut through the heavy broth.

	1/2 red pepper sliced
	350 g of pork meat (I like cheek best)
	1 x 440 g can of chopped tomato
	1/4 x 50 g can of anchovies
	1 teaspoon garlic oil
	1 teaspoon onion oil
	1 teaspoon regular oil
	1 stick celery
	1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
	1 teaspoon salt
	3 taspoons paprika
	1/2 teaspoon cayenne
	1 teaspoon smoked paprika
	
	
* Preheat the oven to 120 Celsius.
* Heat the oils over a medium to high heat in a casserole dish.

* Fry for 3-5 minutes, until the celery softens.
* Add the meat and paprikas and anchovies.
* Continue cooking, stirring, for 3 minutes.
