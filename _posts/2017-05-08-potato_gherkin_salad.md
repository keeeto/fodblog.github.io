This is a fresh, light take on potato salad. Generally I find potato salad pretty overly stodgy swimming in heavy mayo. In this version the introduction of pickled gherkin and capers cuts right through the stodge - also I recommend the use of far less mayo than normal. If you don't like mayo at all, try replacing it with a mustard and balsamic dressing.

	150 g small new potatos
	500 ml water
	4 pickled gherkins
	Green parts of 1 scallion
	1/2 tablespoon mayonaisse
	1 teaspoon capers
	50 g mature cheddar cheese
	
* Prepare the potatoes - make sure they are all similar in size (around 1 inch), cut larger ones to size if required.
* Place the potatoes in the water in a saucepan over a high heat.
* Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and reduce heat to medium.
* Allow to simmer for 5 - 8 minutes, checking the potatoes, ideally you want them still firm, but not crunchy. If they still feel like an apple when you stick a knife in, they are not ready.
* Prepare the gherkins, cutting into 1 cm cubes.
* Prepare the cheese, cutting into 1 cm cubes.
* Finely chop the scallion.
* Mix all ingredients except the potato and mayo in a bowl.
* Allow the potato to cool a little (not to melt the cheese).
* Add the potatos and mayo and mix.
