You can sometimes buy onion infuse oil in supermarkets. But if you can't find it, don't worry, it's easy to make.

	1 cup oil (vegetable, sunflower, olive, as you please)
	2 onions, peeled and chopped into six pieces each
	
* Put the oil and the onion in a small flat-bottomed saucepan.
* Heat over a medium heat. 
* When the onion starts to go brown (10 - 15ish minutes) remove from the heat and allow to cool.
* When cool strain the oil through a fine sieve into a sterilised jar. [Here's how to sterilise a jar.](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-sterilise-jars)
* The oil you make this way will keep for about a week in the fridge.
* Feel free to combine garlic and onion if that's what you want. I find it gives more flexibility to do them separately, but it is more of a pain to do.
