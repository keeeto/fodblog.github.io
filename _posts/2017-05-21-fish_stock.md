Stock cubes can be a pretty insidious and unexpected source of fodmaps. They often contain things like onion or garlic powder, creeping up where you least expect them. Obviously we are going to need stocks for many of the dishes on this site. The good news is that home made stock is easy, efficient and generally more tasty than that from cubes. Witness the bizarre catheter bags of stock that one can purchase for exorbitant prices from supermarkets these days!

	250 g fish trimmings (bones, tails, heads)
	1 litre water
	1 stick celery
	1 carrot
	
* Bring all of the ingredients to the boil in a saucepan.
* Boil for 15 - 20 minutes.
* Strain the stock from the solids.
* Done - store in the fridge for a week, or freeze for longer preservation.
